# Personal Profile

Hello! I'm a doctoral researcher in Computer Engineering with a background in Electrical-Electronics Engineering. Over the past five years, my research has focused on designing model-based controllers for nonlinear electromechanical systems, particularly in robotics and nonlinear control. With a total of eight years of experience in programming, research, and design, I have worked on a diverse range of projects.

I am proficient in C/C++, Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and MATLAB/Simulink, with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in research or industry roles involving cutting-edge projects and professional growth.
