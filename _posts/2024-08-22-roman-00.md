## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary components for constructing and operating a 3-DOF planar direct drive robotic manipulator. The project includes:

- **A CAD model** of the robot design
- **Embedded code** running on the data acquisition card
- **Circuit design** of the data acquisition card
- **A MATLAB project template** for implementing and simulating control algorithms

The schematic of this experimental setup is shown in the figure below. The control algorithms are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, referred to as the Control Unit in the diagram. The custom Data Acquisition Device gathers encoder signals from the robot and sends them to the Control Unit. It also receives control signals from the Control Unit and transforms them into voltages, which are then amplified before being sent to the robot. The experiments run in real-time with a sampling rate of up to 10 kHz.
