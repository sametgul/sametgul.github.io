This series of posts details the essential components required for constructing and operating a 3-DOF planar direct-drive robotic manipulator. The project encompasses:

- **Control Unit**: A MATLAB project template for implementing and simulating control algorithms.
- **Embedded Code**: Software running on the data acquisition card.
- **Circuit Design**: The schematic and layout of the data acquisition card.
- **CAD Model**: A comprehensive model of the robotic design.

The complete project repository is available on **GitHub**: [Roman3D Project Repo](https://github.com/sametgul/roman3d.git)

Figure 1 illustrates the schematic of the experimental setup. The control algorithms, referred to as the `Control Unit`, are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The custom `Data Acquisition Device` collects encoder signals from the robot and transmits them to the `Control Unit`. It also converts control signals from the `Control Unit` into voltages, which are then amplified by the `Amplificator` before being sent to the `3-DOF Robotic Manipulator`. These experiments are conducted in real-time with a sampling rate of up to 10 kHz.
